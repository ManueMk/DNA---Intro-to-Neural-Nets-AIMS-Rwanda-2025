# DNA---Intro-to-Neural-Nets-AIMS-Rwanda-2025


Kaggle Competition where I was the first with my teammate: https://www.kaggle.com/t/b62a870542854434beaa06169dd4bf48 


The goal of the data challenge is to learn how to implement neural networks, gain understanding about them and adapt them to structural data.
For this reason, we have chosen a sequence classification task: predicting whether a DNA sequence region is binding site to a specific transcription factor.

A Transcription factors (TFs) is a regulatory protein that binds (or attaches itself) to specific sequence motifs in the genome to activate or repress transcription of target genes.
The classification task is the following: given a DNA sequence, determine whether the transcription factor will bind (label 1) or not (label 0)
